# SPOT EXCHANGE RATE
[Project Page](https://dennishsu716.github.io/project6.github.io/project5/project5.html)
## Summary
Using HTML in conjunction with a real-time exchange rate API as the foundation, develop an intuitive and practical currency query and conversion application. By leveraging the ExchangeRate-API, implement real-time exchange rate updates and conversion functions for multiple currencies, enabling users to quickly access accurate exchange rate information.
The implementation of the project is divided into three main components: page structure design, data interaction, and functionality expansion. First, use HTML to create the basic structure of the page, incorporating simple and intuitive input fields, a dropdown menu for selecting currencies, and a results display area. Enhance the page's aesthetic appeal with CSS to ensure a user-friendly experience and an attractive interface. Secondly, JavaScript plays a crucial role in this project, handling requests to the API and processing the returned JSON data. After the user inputs an amount and selects a currency, the system promptly requests the latest data from the exchange rate API, performs the necessary calculations, and updates the results area to provide immediate feedback.
