## Summary
Using HTML in conjunction with a real-time exchange rate API as the foundation, develop an intuitive and practical currency query and conversion application. By leveraging the ExchangeRate-API, implement real-time exchange rate updates and conversion functions for multiple currencies, enabling users to quickly access accurate exchange rate information.
The implementation of the project is divided into three main components: page structure design, data interaction, and functionality expansion. First, use HTML to create the basic structure of the page, incorporating simple and intuitive input fields, a dropdown menu for selecting currencies, and a results display area. Enhance the page's aesthetic appeal with CSS to ensure a user-friendly experience and an attractive interface. Secondly, JavaScript plays a crucial role in this project, handling requests to the API and processing the returned JSON data. After the user inputs an amount and selects a currency, the system promptly requests the latest data from the exchange rate API, performs the necessary calculations, and updates the results area to provide immediate feedback.

## About the future plans
In the future, some real-time chart tickets can be added to add some real-time K-line charts to make it easier for users to see, or it can be combined with stocks and virtual currencies so that users can see all the information they want to see on a single web page.
